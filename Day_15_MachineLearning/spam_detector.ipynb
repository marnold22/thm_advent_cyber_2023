    "- When the model is trained with Naive Bayes and gets a new email that says (for example) \"Win a free toy now!\", then it thinks:\n",
    "       -  \"Win\" often appears in spam, so this increases the chance of the email being spam.\n",
    "       -  \"Free\" is also common in spam, further increasing the spam probability.\n",
    "       -  \"Toy\" might be neutral, often appearing in both spam and ham.\n",
    "       -  After considering all the words, it calculates the overall probability of the email being spam and ham.\n",
